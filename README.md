# Implementation of 2048 Game using Data Structures and Algorithms

## Description:
The project involves creating a digital implementation of the popular puzzle game "2048" using the Python programming language. The primary focus will be on employing data structures, algorithms, and the Tkinter library to develop an interactive and playable version of the game.

## Key Components and Features

**1.) Game Logic:** Implement the core game mechanics of combining tiles with the same value to create new tiles, as well as the logic for moving tiles in different directions (up, down, left, and right).

**2.) Data Structures:** Utilize a suitable data structure, such as a 2D matrix, to represent the game board. Each cell of the matrix will contain the value of the tile.

**3.) Algorithm:** Develop an algorithm for merging tiles, shifting tiles, and updating the game board after each move. Efficient algorithms will be crucial to ensure smooth gameplay and accurate tile manipulation.

**4.) User Interface (UI):** Use the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface for the game. Design the game board, tiles, and user interface elements to provide an engaging and intuitive experience.
